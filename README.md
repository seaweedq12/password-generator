# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Task

In this weeks homework we were given a starter code in which we add codes to a script.js file so that a user can generate passwords after making choice in which what the password is going to contain, for example "is the password going to contain number?"

## Work

1. Firstly when the generate button is pressed the user is prompt to a input in which the user is ask to enter the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters.

2. If a correct input is placed then three confirms will pop in order, whether to include capital letter, number and special letters. The user can choice include or not include with the ok and cancel button.
